This is a proposal for IEEE PICO design contest. Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG) Mux and Signal Conditioning is one of the six building blocks of the chip called “lab bench on a chip” system that can be used to characterize basic analog circuit blocks through oscilloscope and waveform generator functionality.The simulations of different modules of AWG MUX & Signal Conditioning i.e. transimpedance stage, buffer, differential op amp with VOCM, low pass filter and differential DEMUX are done using cadence tools (130nm PDK). The required specifications of bandwidth=5.3MHz, slew rate=138MV/s, and AWG load capacitance (CL=497 fF) have been efficiently met. The design is based on folded cascode op-amp which have high bandwidth, slew rate and gain. Secondly the basic model of AWG Mux is implemented using open-source tool, Xschem (Skywater 130nm PDK). The next step is to implement this design using the open-source tools (Xschem, Magic) GF MCU 180nm PDK.
